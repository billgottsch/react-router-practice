This project was created as practice for an assignment in The Iron Yard.

###What is it?
A very simple project that uses create-react-app and AJAX requests with Axios, Google Map and builds our first multi-page site as practice.

###What does it do?
There are three sections and an error section. Home, Stores and About being the main pages. All created with their own page in mind, they are simply styled and designed with functionality being the key component. The client can bring up individual stores and be directed via Google Maps on the location.
